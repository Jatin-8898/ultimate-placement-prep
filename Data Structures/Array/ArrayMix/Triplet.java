/* 
    Efficient approach: If we sort the given listay, we can improve the efficiency of the algorithm. This efficient approach uses the two-pointer technique as follows:

    Sort the given listay.
    Loop over the listay and fix the first element of the possible triplet, list[i].
    Then fix two pointers, one at i + 1 and the other at n â€“ 1. And look at the sum,
    If the sum is smaller than the sum we need to get to, we increase the first pointer.
    Else, If the sum is bigger, we decrease the end pointer to reduce the sum.
    We also update the closest sum found so far.
